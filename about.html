                  My name is Ali. I started beekeeping since 2020. I met one of my friends in 2019 who keeps two hives as a hobby. He gave me a book, which was about beekeeping. The book had explained  everything about honeybees. After studying that book I became so interested in beekeeping and decided to start beekeeping  specially when I noticed that the number of honeybees is decreasing worldwide. I keep honeybees as a hobby and a side job. I usually research about the kinds of the herbs and plants that attract bees  and give a good taste to honey and are useful for  human. I do my best to keep my honey healthy and nutritious.
